# Predicting-Profits-

This repository contains a comprehensive multiple linear regression analysis conducted by me using SkLean and Python. The repository leverages data from Kaggle.

Future Improvements
This project lays the groundwork for predictive analytics in profit forecasting. Going forward, an important next step would be to delve deeper into model evaluation and refinement. By leveraging a comprehensive set of performance metrics, such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), we can gain a better understanding of the model's accuracy and predictive power. This analysis will enable us to identify areas for improvement and optimize the model further
